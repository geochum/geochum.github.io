## Welcome to My Professional Portfolio

I am George Chumbipuma, a Ph.D. student in Computational & Applied Mathematics at Rice University. My academic journey has been fueled by a passion for exploring complex mathematical problems and applying computational methods to solve real-world challenges.

### Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on numerical methods, optimization techniques, and high-performance computing. I am particularly interested in applying these methods to problems in mathematical physics and engineering. My goal is to contribute to advancements in these fields through rigorous research and collaboration. I aspire to contribute as a research scientist in the future.

You can explore my research in more detail on the [Research](/research/) page.


### Teaching, Mentoring, and Tutoring

Throughout my academic career, I have been involved in education, serving as a math educator and mentor. This experience has allowed me to refine my communication skills and convey complex concepts in an accessible way, which has been invaluable in both my academic and professional development.

In addition to mentoring, I run a tutoring service, **Pumatics**, where I offer personalized tutoring in math, science, computer science, and test preparation. You can learn more about this venture on the [Tutoring](/tutoring/) page.
