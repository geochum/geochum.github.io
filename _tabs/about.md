# About

I am Jorge (George) Chumbipuma, a Ph.D. student in Computational & Applied Mathematics at Rice University, working on numerical methods for PDEs with applications in scientific machine learning.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **scientific machine learning (SciML)** and **numerical methods**.

I develop and analyze **Numerics-Informed Neural Networks (NINNs)** — time-marching neural solvers for parabolic PDEs — and compare them against traditional methods such as Backward Euler and Crank–Nicolson. My work focuses on stability, error propagation, and convergence in neural PDE frameworks.

I implement and run computations on HPC clusters (Rice NOTs) and have experience with GPU computing and distributed algorithms from my internship at **Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory**.

Earlier interests in porous media and fracture modeling continue to influence my perspective on multiscale, multiphysics problems.

My research is supported by the **NDSEG Fellowship** (Department of Defense) and **GEM Fellowship** (sponsored by MIT Lincoln Laboratory). You can explore my ongoing projects and research on the [Research](/research/) page.

## Experience

- **Scientific Computing Intern – Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory** (Summer 2025)  
  Worked on GPU-enabled optimization in the HiOp framework: implemented RAJA-based solvers with MPI support and ported quasi-Newton methods to CUDA.

- **Summer Research Intern – MIT Lincoln Laboratory** (Summer 2024)  
  Conducted research on modeling and analysis of Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) systems. Developed mathematical models and implemented simulations in MATLAB to analyze system behavior under varied mission parameters.

<!-- - **Virtual Math Instructor – Art of Problem Solving (2023–present)**  
  Teach middle- and high-school students in courses such as Prealgebra, Algebra, and Precalculus. -->

  Mentored a Latina student transitioning to graduate-level mathematics through SACNAS's Mentorship Activated by SACNISTAs (MAS) Circle, providing biweekly check-ins, academic guidance, and resources toward her PhD goal.

- **Fellowship Panel Discussion**, Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium (GCURS), Rice University (October 2025)  
  Invited panelist representing NDSEG alongside panelists from NSF GRFP, Fulbright, Hertz, and Goldwater fellowships. Shared insights on fellowship application processes and opportunities.

<!-- - **Participant — Activation 1:1 Coaching Program**, Rice University Doerr Institute for New Leaders (August 2023 — December 2023)  
  Completed semester-long, personalized leadership coaching with an ICF-certified coach. Strengthened skills in empathic listening, delegation, trust-building, and emotional intelligence. -->
