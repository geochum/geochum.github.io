## Welcome to My Professional Portfolio

I am George Chumbipuma, a Ph.D. student in Computational & Applied Mathematics at Rice University. My academic journey has been shaped by a deep passion for leveraging computational mathematics to solve real-world problems. From numerical methods to high-performance computing, my work integrates mathematical rigor with practical applications.

### Research Interests

My research focuses on developing and implementing numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), optimization techniques, and high-performance computing (HPC). Current areas of exploration include:

- **Porous Media Modeling:** Learning to apply discontinuous Galerkin methods to solve the Biot equations for coupled flow and deformation.
- **Fracture Mechanics:** Investigating phase-field modeling to simulate crack propagation in heterogeneous materials.
- **Scalable Computing:** Gaining expertise in parallel computing frameworks such as PETSc and MPI to solve large-scale scientific problems.

I am particularly motivated by applications in energy systems, environmental sustainability, and computational physics. You can explore my ongoing projects and aspirations on the [Research](/research/) page.

### Teaching, Mentoring, and Outreach

I am deeply committed to education and mentorship, especially for underrepresented groups in STEM. As a math educator, I strive to create inclusive learning environments that foster curiosity and growth. My experience includes:

- Serving as a **Virtual Math Instructor** with the Art of Problem Solving Academy.
- Founding **Pumatics**, a tutoring service offering personalized instruction in math, science, computer science, and test preparation. Learn more about this venture on the [Tutoring](/tutoring/) page.
- Participating in diversity-focused conferences such as the **Blackwell-Tapia Conference**, **GEM Annual Board Meeting**, and **SACNAS CareerCon**, which have inspired me to advocate for inclusivity in academia and beyond.
